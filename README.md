The game consists of a maze filled with treasures (bitcoin) and monsters. An explorer (nyan cat) navigates the maze to find all the treasures before it runs into a monster. Monsters are dumb so they move about randomly, but they cannot be seen unless they are within the explorers field of view. Fortunately, the explorer has photographic memory and can recall previously visited spaces and seen treasures.
